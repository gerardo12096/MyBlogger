During this phase I faced a lot of challenges that I thought I wouldn't be able to solve. It has really pushed me to
grow as a programmer and I managed to solve all the challenges that were thrown at me. To start off, creating the tables for subject, description and tags
was a bit challenging because it was my first time actually modeling and working with databases on this level. And then I realized I had to make a seperate
table for tags that relate to comments so that was a challenge in of itself. Figuring out how all these relationships worked and related with each other was
stressful but I enjoyed solving and troubleshooting my errors (I used stackoverflow quite alot). Setting the restrictions on
the users and commenters was a huge challenge because it was the first time I was exposed to doing something like this and relying
soley on reading documentations. Again, this was my first time working with sql queries within my code so setting up the restrictions just right so that
everything works the way it should felt overwhelming at times but I learned a great amount from that experience. Lastly, getting the university.sql script to work
upon initializing the database was one of my biggest struggles. Eventually I had to stop and think logically about how it needs to work and I had come up with an idea that actually
worked so I was really proud of that moment. But I had to edit and modify the script quite a bit to get it to work with my project but everything works perfectly as it should. Overall,
I feel pretty accomplished and proud of what I was able to achieve during these phases because I faced with challenges I never thought I would be able to solve, especially working alone.
